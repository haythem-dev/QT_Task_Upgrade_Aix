# Qt 5.15.0 for AIX with GCC 4.6.3 - Development History

This document chronicles the development process of the Qt 5.15.0 patching project for AIX 7.2 with GCC 4.6.3 compatibility.

## Project Overview

The goal was to create a modified version of Qt 5.15.0 that can be built on AIX 7.2 using GCC 4.6.3, which lacks full C++11 support. This required creating patches for key C++11 features used in Qt that aren't supported by this older compiler.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis

We began by analyzing the compatibility issues between Qt 5.15.0's C++11 requirements and GCC 4.6.3's limitations:

1. Identified key C++11 features used in Qt that aren't supported in GCC 4.6.3:
   - `auto` keyword usage
   - Template aliases (`using` declarations)
   - Lambda expressions
   - `nullptr` keyword
   - Atomic operations with memory ordering
   - Various template metaprogramming features

2. Created a testing framework (`mock_build_test.py`) to simulate these issues and validate our patch solutions.

3. Developed an environment analysis tool (`qt_build_planner.py`) to detect system compatibility and assist with the build process.

### Phase 2: Patch Development

We created several targeted patches to address the compatibility issues:

1. **01-qtbase-configure-gcc463.patch**:
   - Added GCC 4.6.3 detection to the configure script
   - Disabled specific features that rely on unsupported C++11 capabilities

2. **02-qtbase-qglobal-cpp11-compat.patch**:
   - Added a compatibility layer in `qglobal.h` for template aliases
   - Provided implementations for `std::decay_t`, `std::is_same`, and `std::enable_if`
   - Added `nullptr` compatibility definitions

3. **03-qtbase-qalgorithms-auto-fix.patch**:
   - Replaced `auto` keyword usage with explicit types in `qalgorithms.h`
   - Used `qptrdiff` instead of `auto` for iterator differences

4. **04-qtbase-qatomic-cxx11-fix.patch**:
   - Added atomic operation compatibility for GCC 4.6.3
   - Implemented missing memory ordering operations

5. **AIX-specific platform patches**:
   - Modified `qplatformdefs.h` for AIX compatibility
   - Updated `qmake.conf` with appropriate compiler flags

### Phase 3: Build Process Development

We created scripts to automate the build process:

1. **apply_edit_patches.sh**:
   - Applied patches to the original Qt source
   - Verified patch application success

2. **build-qt515-aix-gcc463.sh**:
   - Configured environment variables for AIX
   - Set appropriate build flags and options

3. **manually_create_patched_version.sh** and **finish_patching.sh**:
   - Created a fully patched version ready for deployment
   - Applied patches directly to the source files

### Phase 4: Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation:

1. **README-build-steps.md**:
   - Detailed step-by-step build instructions
   - Environment setup guidance
   - Verification procedures

2. **troubleshooting_guide.md**:
   - Solutions for common build issues
   - C++11 compatibility problems and their fixes
   - Advanced troubleshooting techniques

3. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**:
   - Overview of the entire project
   - List of compatibility issues addressed
   - Future improvement possibilities

4. **README-PATCHED.md**:
   - Documentation specific to the patched version
   - Instructions for building on AIX
   - Limitations and feature exclusions

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Auto Keyword
**Problem**: GCC 4.6.3 has limited support for the `auto` keyword in C++11.
**Solution**: Replaced all `auto` keyword usages with explicit types like `qptrdiff`.

### Challenge 2: Template Aliases
**Problem**: GCC 4.6.3 doesn't support template aliases (using declarations).
**Solution**: Created a compatibility layer using struct composition and inheritance to mimic template aliases.

### Challenge 3: Atomic Operations
**Problem**: GCC 4.6.3 lacks C++11 atomic operations with memory ordering parameters.
**Solution**: Provided simplified atomic operation implementations and macros to replace the missing functionality.

### Challenge 4: nullptr
**Problem**: GCC 4.6.3 doesn't fully support the nullptr keyword.
**Solution**: Added a macro to define nullptr as NULL when compiling with GCC 4.6.3.

### Challenge 5: Build Configuration
**Problem**: Standard Qt build options enable features incompatible with GCC 4.6.3.
**Solution**: Created a custom build configuration that disables problematic features and sets appropriate compiler flags.

## Final Outcome

The project successfully created a patched version of Qt 5.15.0 that can be built on AIX 7.2 with GCC 4.6.3. The patched version maintains most of Qt's core functionality while working around the C++11 limitations of the older compiler.

Key components of the final solution:
1. A fully patched Qt 5.15.0 source directory ready for building on AIX
2. A custom build script for easily compiling on AIX systems
3. Comprehensive documentation for building and troubleshooting
4. Analysis tools to help identify and fix additional compatibility issues

## Discussion Highlights

Throughout the development process, we discussed several important aspects:

1. Balancing feature support vs. compatibility:
   - Decided to disable some features (OpenGL, Vulkan, SQLite) to simplify the build
   - Kept core Qt functionality (GUI, Widgets) with compatibility patches

2. Patch application strategy:
   - Initially created separate patch files for better tracking and management
   - Later developed a directly patched version for easier deployment

3. Build approach:
   - Created a reduced feature configuration to avoid C++11 dependent components
   - Set appropriate compiler flags for AIX 64-bit mode

4. Testing methodology:
   - Developed mock tests to verify patches address the right issues
   - Created verification steps to ensure patch application success

The result is a robust solution for building Qt 5.15.0 on AIX 7.2 with GCC 4.6.3, enabling the development of modern Qt applications on this platform despite the limitations of the older compiler.
