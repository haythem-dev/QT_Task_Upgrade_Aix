# Qt 5.15.0 AIX PowerPC POWER9 Build Toolkit

A specialized build automation toolkit for compiling Qt 5.15.0 on AIX 7.2 PowerPC POWER9 architecture with GCC 4.6.3, providing advanced compatibility patching for C++11 features.

## Project Overview

This toolkit addresses the challenge of building Qt 5.15.0 on AIX 7.2 with an older GCC 4.6.3 compiler that lacks full C++11 support. Qt 5.15.0 heavily relies on C++11 features, making direct compilation impossible without significant patching.

### Key Components

- **Patch Generation and Management**: Custom patches addressing C++11 compatibility issues
- **Build Configuration**: Specialized configuration for AIX with GCC 4.6.3
- **Environment Analysis**: Tools to analyze system requirements and dependencies
- **Testing Framework**: Mock build testing for patch verification

## Compatibility Challenges Addressed

- **Limited C++11 Support**: GCC 4.6.3 has incomplete C++11 implementation
- **Auto Keyword**: Replaced with explicit types throughout the codebase
- **Template Aliases**: Implemented workarounds for template alias syntax
- **Atomic Operations**: Created compatibility layer for C++11 atomic operations
- **Lambda Expressions**: Limited lambda usage patched with function objects
- **Move Semantics**: Provided fallbacks for C++11 move semantics
- **nullptr**: Replaced with compatible alternatives

## Usage

1. **Analyze Your Environment**:
   ```
   python qt_build_planner.py --analyze
   ```

2. **Generate Build Scripts**:
   ```
   python qt_build_planner.py --generate-scripts
   ```

   ```
   ./apply_edit_patches.sh
   ```

4. **Follow Build Instructions**:
   See `README-build-steps.md` for detailed instructions.

## Build Requirements

- AIX 7.2 on PowerPC POWER9
- GCC 4.6.3
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 10GB+ disk space
- Standard AIX development tools

## Limitations

This patched version has some limitations compared to standard Qt 5.15.0:
- Some features requiring advanced C++11 support are disabled
- OpenGL and Vulkan support is disabled
- SQLite support is disabled by default
- Some multithreading features may have reduced functionality

These limitations are necessary to maintain compatibility with GCC 4.6.3 on AIX 7.2.
