# Development History

This document outlines the development process and key milestones in the Qt 5.15.0 AIX/GCC 4.6.3 compatibility project.

## Phase 1: Research and Analysis

### Initial Research
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of Qt 5.15.0 codebase to identify C++11 usage patterns
- Researched GCC 4.6.3 C++11 feature support limitations
- Identified key areas requiring patching:
  - Header files with extensive template usage
  - Core library components using auto keyword
  - Atomic operations implementation
  - Lambda expressions and closures

### Environment Analysis
- Created system analysis tool (`qt_build_planner.py`) to:
  - Detect compiler version and features
  - Analyze system libraries
  - Generate environment compatibility report
- Documented AIX-specific considerations for Qt 5.15.0 builds

## Phase 2: Core Patching Development

### Patch Strategy Development
- Created structured approach to patching:
  1. Platform-specific patches (AIX support)
  2. Compiler-specific patches (GCC 4.6.3 compatibility)
- Organized patches in logical sequence to minimize conflicts

### Initial Patch Set Creation
- Created `qt-5.15.0-aix-fixes.patch` for general AIX platform compatibility
- Developed compiler-specific patches:
  - `01-qtbase-configure-gcc463.patch`: Configure script modifications
  - `02-qtbase-qglobal-cpp11-compat.patch`: Global compatibility layer
  - `03-qtbase-qalgorithms-auto-fix.patch`: Auto keyword replacements
  - `04-qtbase-qatomic-cxx11-fix.patch`: Atomic operations compatibility

### Testing Framework
- Developed `mock_build_test.py` to verify patch effectiveness
- Created test cases for each compatibility issue
- Implemented simulated build environment for patch testing

## Phase 3: Build System Integration

### Configure Script Modification
- Modified Qt configure script to detect GCC 4.6.3
- Implemented conditional feature disabling based on compiler capabilities
- Adjusted build flags for AIX compatibility

### Makefile Generation
- Created custom qmake configuration for AIX/GCC 4.6.3
- Modified mkspecs files for proper platform support
- Implemented workarounds for compiler limitations

### Compatibility Layer Implementation
- Created compatibility header with preprocessor-based workarounds
- Implemented template specializations for missing C++11 functionality
- Developed fallback mechanisms for unavailable features

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

### Incremental Testing
- Tested each patch individually for compatibility
- Verified combined patch set functionality
- Addressed edge cases and unexpected interactions

### Patch Refinement
- Optimized patches for minimal source code modification
- Improved inline documentation of workarounds
- Created unified patch application approach

### Build Verification
- Tested the build process end-to-end in a simulated environment
- Verified compilation of essential Qt components
- Documented remaining limitations and alternatives

## Phase 5: Documentation and Packaging

### Build Documentation
- Created `README-build-steps.md` with detailed instructions
- Documented command-line options and environment variables
- Provided examples for common build scenarios

### Troubleshooting Guide
- Developed `troubleshooting_guide.md` for common issues
- Provided solutions for compiler errors and build failures
- Added explanations for workaround limitations

### Package Creation
- Generated complete patched source tree for direct use
- Created essential files package for selective patching
- Prepared distribution archives in multiple formats

## Phase 6: Project Completion

### Final Verification
- Conducted comprehensive testing of all components
- Verified documentation accuracy and completeness
- Ensured all scripts and tools function as expected

### Project Summary
- Created `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` documenting accomplishments
- Outlined technical approaches and implementation details
- Documented limitations and potential future enhancements

### Release Preparation
- Organized all project artifacts for distribution
- Created final release packages
- Prepared handover documentation

## Design Decisions and Rationale

### Patch Organization Strategy
- Separated platform-specific and compiler-specific patches to allow selective application
- Used numbered patches for dependency ordering
- Maintained minimal changes to improve maintainability

### C++11 Workaround Approach
- Prioritized standard C++03 equivalents when available
- Used preprocessor conditionals to minimize code duplication
- Implemented compatibility types to maintain API consistency

### Feature Disabling Strategy
- Disabled features only when no viable workaround exists
- Provided clear documentation of disabled functionality
- Created alternative implementation paths where possible

### Testing Methodology
- Used mock testing for rapid iteration
- Implemented progressive testing from unit to integration level
- Created reproducible test cases for all compatibility issues
